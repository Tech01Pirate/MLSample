# MLSampleAppConsole

## Overview

MLSampleAppConsole is a .NET 8 console application that demonstrates how to use Azure Content Safety APIs to analyze and moderate user-provided text content. The app allows users to input text, detects potentially unsafe content across several categories (Hate, SelfHarm, Sexual, Violence), and makes automated decisions based on configurable thresholds.

## Features

- **Interactive Console Input:** Users can enter text to be analyzed for safety.
- **Content Safety Detection:** Integrates with Azure Content Safety API to detect unsafe content.
- **Configurable Thresholds:** Set custom reject thresholds for each category.
- **Automated Decision Making:** Accepts or rejects content based on detection results.
- **Extensible Model:** Easily add new categories or media types.

## Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- An Azure Content Safety endpoint and subscription key

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd MLSampleApp/MLSampleAppConsole
```

### 2. Configure Azure Credentials

Edit `Programm.cs` and set your Azure Content Safety `endpoint` and `subscriptionKey`:

```csharp
const string endpoint = "<your-azure-endpoint>";
const string subscriptionKey = "<your-azure-subscription-key>";
```

### 3. Build the Project

```sh
dotnet build
```

### 4. Run the Application

```sh
dotnet run
```

### 5. Usage

- When prompted, enter the text you want to test for content safety.
- The app will analyze the text and display the decision (Accept/Reject) based on the configured thresholds.
- The process repeats for new input.

## Example

```
---------------------------------
Enter the content to be Tested.
> This is a test message.
Decision: Accept
```

## Project Structure

- `Programm.cs` - Main application logic and entry point.
- `Models/DetectionResult.cs` - Model for detection results.
- `Models/DetectionException.cs` - Exception handling for detection errors.
- `Enums.cs` - Enumerations for media types, categories, and actions.

## Extending

- Add new categories to `Enums.cs`.
- Modify threshold logic in `Programm.cs`.
- Extend models in the `Models` folder for more detailed analysis.
